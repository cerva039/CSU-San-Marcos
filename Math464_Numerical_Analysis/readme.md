Mathematics course focused on interpolation and approximation of specific values.

e.g. How to calculate the square root of 2 without a calculator or find the integral of sin^2(x)

The files posted are primarily to be used in MatLab, but work just as well in the freeware Octave software. 
(minor code ajustments may be necessary as pointed out in the Octave compiler)
