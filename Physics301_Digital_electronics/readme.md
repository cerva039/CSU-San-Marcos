Physics course focused on introductory & semi-intermediate electronic concepts: Logic Gates, Flip Flops, Registers, etc. all the way up to a final project showcasing an 8-bit microprocessor.  

First quarter of class focused on building these circuits by hand with supplied tools (breadboard, 5V power supply, jumper cables, pliers, etc), with remainder of course focused on creating/emulating more complex circuits in the Xilinx ISE software. 

Due to the nature of the physical hardware, only pictures of the work will be uploaded (along with an accompanying description of the assignment at a later time).
