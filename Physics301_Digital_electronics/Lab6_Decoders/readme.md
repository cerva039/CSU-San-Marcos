Consisting of several experiments, this lab focused heavily on decoders and multiplexors.  
Different from previous labs (and of most coming after) was the interfacing of a separate keypad tool; The operation of prior circuits used switches and buttons for inputs, but this time we now use keypad buttons as our inputs.

Most programs/Xilinx modules that utilize the keypad were created by the professor of this course, and as such I only claim credit for the layout of the circuit. (the appropriate VHDL code is already commented by the professor)

Due to the rapidly increasing complexity of each experiment, from here on their pdf designs will be located within their appropriate folders.
